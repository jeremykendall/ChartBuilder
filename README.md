ChartBuilder
============

A family of PHP classes that enable you to easily define the various components that make up a complex chart of graph. ChartBuilder's architecture supports plug-in "renderers," which can then take this data and display it however the plug-in sees fit (i.e. Flot, D3, etc...).
